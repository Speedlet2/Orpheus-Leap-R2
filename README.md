# Orpheus-Leap-R2

This is the repository containing the current basic ideas for [Hack Club's](https://github.com/hackclub) new 'Orpheus Leap' uController board. The original version was designed by [Kevin Yang](https://github.com/kvnyng) in 2020 and can be found [here](https://github.com/kvnyng/Orpheus-Leap-Micro). This is currently very early in development, with the basic architecture not yet finalised. Feel free to add any ideas/problems in an issue
